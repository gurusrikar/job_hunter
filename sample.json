The Operations team drives the systems that power this growth in a stable, secure, and performant way, and we are looking for YOU to join our team. </p>\n\n<p>Our technology stack is modern and always changing, but we are thoughtful and deliberate about bringing new technologies. Currently most of our services are fat-JAR Scala deployments to Chef-configured Ubuntu&#39;s that end up directly on AWS or on Mesos, with lots of RabbitMQ traffic between them, backed by MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Postgres, and you should be comfortable in that sort of environment, using Python to automate everything you can. Or Ruby if you have to. Where we can, we make decisions based on data, and the ideal candidate would know how to use tools such as Librato and Splunk to get a global understanding of the system but also be able to get down and dirty in the shell on individual machines. On-call rotation is part of the role, as you might expect, but we work hard to make that not suck. </p>\n\n<p>Since we manage health-care data, we must comply with HIPAA and related laws, and good decision-making and data-defensive thinking are critical for our team members. We are especially interested in candidates who have DBA experience with a relational or NoSQL database and/or who have worked in a HITRUST-guided or regulated environment. </p>\n\n<p>Our culture is important to us and we cultivate it carefully. We do not strive for heroism and while we recognize and reward individual accomplishments, we know that ultimately, teams win. Most of our projects are paired work and several of our team members are embedded in development teams. I almost wrote this whole job posting without saying DevOps. Oh well! Yeah, we do that too, whatever it is.  </p>\n\n<p>Our projects are run without regard to geography. You will be working on teams with members in Washington, D.C., Chicago, and San Francisco, and we welcome applications to any of those offices.\nIn addition to a typical startup benefit package, we offer free health care for individuals (families prorated and highly discounted), catered lunches every day and snacks, unlimited PTO, and competitive compensation including stock options.</p>\n',
